📈 Key Insights:
Engagement averaged ~10% across platforms
Video content showed stronger CTR performance
ROI varied significantly across campaigns
High spend did not always correlate with higher growth

🔎 BUSINESS INSIGHTS:
1. Engagement ≠ Follower Growth
High engagement campaigns did not always translate into proportional follower growth.
This indicates that engagement-driven content may be entertaining but not conversion-focused.

2. Platform Performance is Uneven:
Certain platforms drive:
Higher engagement rate
But lower engagement per spend
This suggests inefficient ad allocation.

3. Video Content Outperforms Static Formats:
Video/Reels consistently show:
Higher CTR
Higher engagement rate
Static images generate impressions but lower interaction depth.

4. Campaign ROI Varies Significantly:
High ad spend does not guarantee high engagement efficiency.
Some mid-budget campaigns delivered better ROI than heavy-spend campaigns.

5. Hashtag Strategy Impacts Discoverability:
Frequently used hashtags do not always produce highest engagement rate.
Overused tags reduce marginal impact.

📌 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Shift Budget Toward High ROI Platforms-
Reallocate spend from low efficiency platforms to those with higher engagement per spend.

2. Prioritize Video-First Content Strategy-
Increase short-form video production, especially during campaign periods.

3. Optimize Campaign Spend Allocation-
Introduce ROI threshold criteria before scaling ad budgets.

4. Align Engagement Content with Growth Objective

Design content that includes:
Clear follow CTAs
Community-driven hooks
Loyalty triggers

5. Adopt Data-Driven Hashtag Strategy-

Use performance-based hashtag rotation instead of repetitive tagging.

🎯 Executive-Level Summary
Myntra should move from:
“High spend + high volume marketing”
To:
“Efficiency-driven, ROI-optimized, platform-specific strategy”
